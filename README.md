## Overview of the Project
This is a unity project that visualizes and simulates lighting for the Kent Denver High School Anschutz Theater.
It was created for the 20% project of the AT Computer Science class under the instruction of Phillian Haynes.

For more information about the project head to https://goo.gl/H9fZ4i to find my formal write up on the project.

## What does the Project include?
The project is built on an imported CAD file of Anschutz theater at the Kent Denver School in Colorado.\

Here are the Components of the Project.

I have four working lights each of which is a GameObject. One spotlight, one D40 and two intelligent lights.

I have a tree which is also a GameObject to test and see the lighting on.

I have 5 camera views to utilize the project in game mode.

I have scripts for each light.

1. You can turn on and off the spotlight with the space bar.

2. You can turn on and off the D40 special with the right shift key.

3. You can turn off the movers with the tab key.

You can change the color of the movers:

   1. The B key turns the lights blue
   2. The C key turns the lights cyan
   3. The M key turns the lights magenta
   4. The Y key turns the lights yellow
   5. The W key turns the lights white
   6. The G key turns the lights green
   7. The R key turns the lights red


## What is Unity?
Unity is a cross platform game engine development software with which half the world's games have been designed.
Unity allows you to build different scenes of a game in scene mode. In game mode you can test and run your scenes.
Scripts are C# code elements which can be applied to objects (GameObjects) to make things happen in game mode.
Unity allows you to control a variety of facotors resulting in a realistic simulation.

2. Click download ZIP.
3. Choose a name to save the file as.
4. Choose a location to save it.
5. Click save.
6. Find the zip folder on your computer where you saved it.

## Explanation of Elements in my project
All objects in Unity (both the lights and the tree) are GameObjects. You can add various types of GameObjects
to your project. You can alter their color, size, function, material and so forth. You can attach components to
GameObjects. To create a new GameObject: go to the hierarchy (left panel) > create > choose what you'd like to create.
or go to the top menu bar > GameObject > select what you'd like to create.

All of my lights have C# script components attached to them. I attach these componenets and create the
GameObjects in scene mode. Game mode is how you can test your project. In game mode when you push play you can run your
scripts. To create a new script: go to assets (bottom panel) > left click > create > select C# script. You can now
create any script. Once you have created a script you can drag it onto the GameObject you want to attach it to or click
on the GameObject > scroll down to click on Component > select script > click the script you'd like to add.
